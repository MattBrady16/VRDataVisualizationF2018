# Graphical Perception Experiments

## 2D Graphical Perception

Replicate the [Cleveland & McGill](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2288400) paper. Consider:

* Compare adjacent bars in a grouped bar chart (Type 1)
* Compare adjacent bars, aligned scale, in a stacked bar chart (Type 2)
* Compare bars in same relative position, but different groups, in a grouped bar chart (Type 3)
* Compare adjacent bars, nonaligned scale, in a stacked bar chart (Type 4)
* Compare two bars within the same group, length assessment, in a stacked bar chart (Type 5)

## Pose-Varying 2D Graphical Perception

Rotate the 2D plot along the y-axis (e.g. up vector relative to view). Perform the same types of assessments as above. Compare VR vs. non-VR. We should expect to see a degradation in both as the angle increases, but does VR have less of an impact?
