||NAME: INTRO
Welcome to the Data Visualization in
Virtual Reality pilot study.
 
Thank you for taking the time to
participate, we appreciate your
contribution! All instructions for this
experiment will appear on this panel.
 
First you will be introduced to the
controls and format of the study, then
the study itself will begin.

Press any button on either controller
to start the tutorial.
||NAME: buttonA
You will be using only three controls
during this experiment, which will be
introduced now.

If at the end of this tutorial you are
still confused about any controls,
please tell one of the group members
and we can explain them further.

The first control is the (A) button,
which is the lowermost round button
on the top of the controller in your
right hand.

Please press the (A) button to continue.
||NAME: buttonX
The second control is the (X) button,
which is the lowermost round button on
the top of the controller in your LEFT
hand.

Please press the (X) button to continue.
||NAME: buttonJoystick
The final control is the joystick on
your right controller. The number to
your right is controlled by moving the
joystick up or down.

Move the joystick to get the number as
close to 50% as you can, then press (A)
to confirm your final answer.
||NAME: taskOverview
The program will show you 60 bar plots
in various positions around the room,
similar to the graphs shown now in the
center of the room.
 
For each graph, you must complete two
tasks:

1. Identify which of the
highlighted orange bars is
taller, by pressing (X) or (A).

2. Estimate the ratio of
the smaller bar to the larger
bar, using the joystick.

Please press the (A) button to continue.
||NAME: taskTiming
Please try to complete these tasks as
quickly as you can without sacrificing
accuracy.

Additionally, since the plots will be
appearing in various places around the
room, feel encouraged to move around to
get a better view, either through leaning,
turning, or actually walking to a
different position.

If you choose to move, please remain
cautious of the objects around you in the
real world - your proctor will try to
warn you if you get close to running into
any.

Please press the (A) button to continue.
||NAME: startSamples
You will now be shown two sample graphs
to test what you've learned.

Please press the (A) button to begin.
||NAME: plotOne
Inspect the two orange bars shown in the
displayed graph, and choose the shorter 
one.

To choose the left bar, 
press the (X) button.

To choose the right bar, 
press the (A) button.
||NAME: plotTwo
Estimate the ratio of the smaller bar to the
larger bar, using the joystick and the meter
displayed on the right of this panel.

Please press the (A) button 
to confirm your choice.
||NAME: TUTORIAL_COMPLETE
The tutorial is now complete!

Please press the (A) button to continue.
